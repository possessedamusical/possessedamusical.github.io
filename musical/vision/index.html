  <h2>Creative Vision</h2>

  <p><strong>
    &quot;I love the way the staging is set against the Tristan and Isolde windows, perfectly mirroring the 3 characters and encapsulating the whole Love and Death theme which runs under all that late romantic period. I can see a stage glowing with these multi layered images and one scene bleeding into another as ghosts and mist rise – there are shades of Turn of the Screw, Wuthering Heights and Bram Stoker.  I think it could be magical.&quot; </strong>
