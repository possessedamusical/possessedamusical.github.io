  <h2>The Project</h2>
          
  <p>Possessed workshops and showcases have been held at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal National Theatre Studio, Greenwich Theatre and Oxford Playhouse.  Leading roles have been played by Anna Francolini, Peter Polycarpou, Caroline Sheen, Joseph Millson, Walter van Dyk and Matthew White.</p>  

  <p>Possessed is now a complete full length, orchestrated musical with a cast of eight.  The music has its roots in Celtic and English folk ballads, with a touch of the Baroque for Morris and some of the comic songs have overtones of the Victorian Music Hall.</p>

  <p>It was nominated by Mercury Musical Developments for the NAMT Festival in New York in 2013 and Specially Commended for the S&amp;S New Musical Theatre Award.  </p>

  <p>Songs from the show are often performed in cabaret.  London venues have included the St James Theatre, Kings Head, The Pheasantry, Josie Laurence's Trying it on at the Menier Chocolate Factory and in the USA by Clearspace Productions.</p>
